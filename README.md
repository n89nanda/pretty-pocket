# Pretty Pocket

When exporting data from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/export), the output file is an HTML file containing the saved URL's without any tags or other metadata visible

[Pretty-Pocket](https://github.com/n89nanda/pretty-pocket) parses the html file and retrieves the metadata like tags, time-added and writes to new Json file which is more clear!

# Usage

`pretty-pocket ril_export.html`
